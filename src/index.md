## 📖 About

IFSRenderer started as a weekend project to help me understand how the fractal flame algorithm works.
My initial goal was to just implement it in 3D, but it has grown into a passion project and then into my master's thesis.
I'm releasing it as an open-source project in the hope that it will be useful to the fractal artist community.
